# KohonenImageCompression
This project aims to compress square images using Kohonen neural network.
## Technolgies
Application implemented using Java 8 and Maven dependency management.
## Requirements
Requirements :
1. 	Image needs to have same width and height.
2. 	Image's width and height values need to be divisable by two without any remainder.

## Compression evaluation :

1. 	PSNR - [PSNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) 
2. 	Compression rate - a factor given by original image's bits number divised by compressed image's bits number.
